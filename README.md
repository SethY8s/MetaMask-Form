# MetaMask form

### `Welcome!`
Today I am going to start my journey of learning blockchain technologies.
I wanted to make this project simple, so all I will be doing is making a form and connecting to MetaMask.
The form will allow users to send eth(and maybe other cryptos later) to another address.

### 'Download/setup'

feel free to clone this repo and start working on it too!

### 'git clone url'
### 'npm install'
### 'npm start'

and that is all!
